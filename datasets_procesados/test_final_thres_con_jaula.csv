Don't ask me how I got stuck there, but I was so frightened, hungry and lost. I am safe now. My rescuer has put me on Avoderm and IAMS diet. She says I've got a good appetite. I have been Frontlined and dewormed too. I have just learned to use the litterbox, so give me a little bit more time and I'll be a pro at that (although my rescuer thinks I'm pretty good at it already)! My rescuer says that I'm very sweet. I've learned to warm up to humans and I love chin rubs and to be cuddled. I feel safe when I'm wrapped up in a blanket and held in someone's arms. I love to run after the cat teaser stick -- it's my favourite toy. I'm also quite good at playing the phone app for cats; it's cool...but nothing like giving the ol' feather stick a good chase! I promise I would make a wonderful kitty if I could grow up in a loving environment. The vet said I'm about 1.5 months old now and looking forward to a long and healthy life! Please contact my rescuer Aida at if you would like to adopt/foster me.

My mum gave birth at the underground car park of an apartment, that’s how me and my siblings were brought to the world, there are 12 of us. Not long after that, my mum was diagnosed with cervical cancer, fortunately she survived after four chemotherapy treatments. And here is my little story. Not long after I was born, I met with an accident and suffered serious concussion, I was wounded with 3 holes in my little head.. Because of that, while all my siblings started to walk I had difficulty to even stand up. In addition to that, I have blurred vision, my cranial nerves were hurt by the accident I suppose.. I have no idea when I’ll recover, maybe it will stay like that forever. Luckily, after 2 months of medication, I’m able to stand and walk now, although I stumbled from time to time. My temporary caretaker has difficulty to keep for me long, I hope that I could meet with a kind master through Facebook. I know people may not like me because of my poor condition, but I’ll pray and hope for a miracle. If you wished to make the miracle happen, please contact my temporary caretaker(Annie). Thank you. 大家好，我的名字叫小龙。我是一只4个多月大的宅男。 妈妈在一个公寓地下停车场里生下了我们12个兄弟姐妹。 妈妈生下了我们之后，得了子宫颈癌。还好，经过4次的化疗之后， 总算挨过了这一关。 好了，说一说我的小故事吧！ 我出世没多久，在一次意外中，我的小脑袋遭到了严重的撞击，破了3个洞。 从此，当其他的兄弟姐妹已经会走路时，我竟然连爬起来都有问题。 还有，我看东西时也是模模糊糊的。我想我的脑部神经可能被弄坏掉了。 我不知道我几时会好起来，或许永远都会是这样。 幸好，吃了两个月的药以后，我总算可以站起来走路。然而，有时还是会跌跌撞撞的。 由于暂养我的主人不能长期收留我，所以我想透过面子书， 寻找一位愿意照顾我一辈子的好心人。 只是，以我这样的生世，或许很难吧。。。。。 有意领养我的好心人，请联络我的暂养主人(Annie)。 我会在这里努力的生活到最后一刻，乖乖的等待我的新主人。请别让我等太久哦。。。 谢谢大家。",0c5d5968b,8.0,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,270,1,1,0,hi there my name is little dragon month old boy my mum gave birth at the underground car park of an apartment that how me and my siblings were brought to the world there are 12 of us not long after that my mum was diagnosed with cervical cancer fortunately she survived after four chemotherapy treatments and here is my little story not long after was born met with an accident and suffered serious concussion was wounded with holes in my little head because of that while all my siblings started to walk had difficulty to even stand up in addition to that have blurred vision my cranial nerves were hurt by the accident suppose have no idea when ll recover maybe it will stay like that forever luckily after months of medication able to stand and walk now although stumbled from time to time my temporary caretaker has difficulty to keep for me long hope that could meet with kind master through facebook know people may not like me because of my poor condition but ll pray and hope for miracle if you wished to make the miracle happen please contact my temporary caretaker annie thank you 大家好 我的名字叫小龙 我是一只4个多月大的宅男 妈妈在一个公寓地下停车场里生下了我们12个兄弟姐妹 妈妈生下了我们之后 得了子宫颈癌 还好 经过4次的化疗之后 总算挨过了这一关 好了 说一说我的小故事吧 我出世没多久 在一次意外中 我的小脑袋遭到了严重的撞击 破了3个洞 从此 当其他的兄弟姐妹已经会走路时 我竟然连爬起来都有问题 还有 我看东西时也是模模糊糊的 我想我的脑部神经可能被弄坏掉了 我不知道我几时会好起来 或许永远都会是这样 幸好 吃了两个月的药以后 我总算可以站起来走路 然而 有时还是会跌跌撞撞的 由于暂养我的主人不能长期收留我 所以我想透过面子书 寻找一位愿意照顾我一辈子的好心人 只是 以我这样的生世 或许很难吧 有意领养我的好心人 请联络我的暂养主人 annie 我会在这里努力的生活到最后一刻 乖乖的等待我的新主人 请别让我等太久哦 谢谢大家,239,135,"['there', 'my', 'name', 'is', 'my', 'at', 'the', 'of', 'an', 'that', 'how', 'me', 'and', 'my', 'were', 'to', 'the', 'there', 'are', 'of', 'us', 'not', 'after', 'that', 'my', 'was', 'with', 'she', 'after', 'four', 'and', 'here', 'is', 'my', 'not', 'after', 'was', 'with', 'an', 'and', 'serious', 'was', 'with', 'in', 'my', 'because', 'of', 'that', 'while', 'all', 'my', 'to', 'had', 'to', 'even', 'up', 'in', 'to', 'that', 'have', 'my', 'were', 'by', 'the', 'have', 'no', 'when', 'it', 'will', 'that', 'after', 'of', 'to', 'and', 'now', 'although', 'from', 'to', 'my', 'has', 'to', 'keep', 'for', 'me', 'that', 'could', 'with', 'through', 'may', 'not', 'me', 'because', 'of', 'my', 'but', 'and', 'for', 'if', 'you', 'to', 'the', 'please', 'my', 'you']","['hi', 'little', 'dragon', 'month', 'old', 'boy', 'mum', 'gave', 'birth', 'underground', 'car', 'park', 'apartment', 'siblings', 'brought', 'world', '12', 'long', 'mum', 'diagnosed', 'cervical', 'cancer', 'fortunately', 'survived', 'chemotherapy', 'treatments', 'little', 'story', 'long', 'born', 'met', 'accident', 'suffered', 'concussion', 'wounded', 'holes', 'little', 'head', 'siblings', 'started', 'walk', 'difficulty', 'stand', 'addition', 'blurred', 'vision', 'cranial', 'nerves', 'hurt', 'accident', 'suppose', 'idea', 'll', 'recover', 'maybe', 'stay', 'like', 'forever', 'luckily', 'months', 'medication', 'able', 'stand', 'walk', 'stumbled', 'time', 'time', 'temporary', 'caretaker', 'difficulty', 'long', 'hope', 'meet', 'kind', 'master', 'facebook', 'know', 'people', 'like', 'poor', 'condition', 'll', 'pray', 'hope', 'miracle', 'wished', 'make', 'miracle', 'happen', 'contact', 'temporary', 'caretaker', 'annie', 'thank', '大家好', '我的名字叫小龙', '我是一只4个多月大的宅男', '妈妈在一个公寓地下停车场里生下了我们12个兄弟姐妹', '妈妈生下了我们之后', '得了子宫颈癌', '还好', '经过4次的化疗之后', '总算挨过了这一关', '好了', '说一说我的小故事吧', '我出世没多久', '在一次意外中', '我的小脑袋遭到了严重的撞击', '破了3个洞', '从此', '当其他的兄弟姐妹已经会走路时', '我竟然连爬起来都有问题', '还有', '我看东西时也是模模糊糊的', '我想我的脑部神经可能被弄坏掉了', '我不知道我几时会好起来', '或许永远都会是这样', '幸好', '吃了两个月的药以后', '我总算可以站起来走路', '然而', '有时还是会跌跌撞撞的', '由于暂养我的主人不能长期收留我', '所以我想透过面子书', '寻找一位愿意照顾我一辈子的好心人', '只是', '以我这样的生世', '或许很难吧', '有意领养我的好心人', '请联络我的暂养主人', 'annie', '我会在这里努力的生活到最后一刻', '乖乖的等待我的新主人', '请别让我等太久哦', '谢谢大家']",little dragon,1,1,3,1,1,3,0.0007805050699971616

Two weeks ago MPSJ dog catcher came over to catch stray dogs at my house area. One female dog got abandoned here few months ago and she has been here for so long. She stays at my street right in front of my neighbors house. The reason was my neighbors dog made her pregnant and since then she was there with 7 puppies, right in front of the husbands house. I love her but I cannot take her in coz I already have four. That day she almost got caught. So I told myself if she comes back safe from her hiding place I will rescue her. Praise The Lord that she came back safe that evening. I took her in and showered her. My neighbor told me that all her puppies are either dead or got caught. She is now vaccinated, spayed and dewormed. Blood test at the vet also showed healthy status. I need someone to adopt her. Or maybe if you can't adopt just help me to foster her till I find her a new home. I can't release her back on the street as I travel very often for work and I don't want her to be caught when I am not around. Please share this message to ppl you know who wants a dog too.

Allow visits in the initial stages of adoption to ensure dog is adjusting well - for this reason adopters residing in Klang Valley are strongly preferred. 5. Unconditional love :) To help determine if you and the dog you're interested in are a good fit, would appreciate it if you could email/text a brief intro of yourself, your experience with dogs if any, your household situation (what type of home you live in i.e. landed or apartment, whether you have other family members/friends living with you etc.) and any other pertinent info.",a5acfe9ed,1.0,1,0.0,0.0,0.4615384615384615,0.3846153846153846,0.1538461538461538,13.0,130,1,0,7200,hey there maximillian maxi my previous owner left me behind when he returned to his home country luckily nice neighbour took me in and would like to find me good home really like people am big lug of love who enjoys pats really good with female dogs but not so good with males spacious compound to run around in would be great for strapping young lad like me love to be taken for daily walks experienced owner who can handle 40kg of excited dog would be ideal oh and really good during car rides any takers for my handsome mug conditions for adoption no unnecessary tying caging up maintain medical needs vaccinations deworming heartworm prevention etc adoption fee of rm to cover neutering cost and partially cover the cost fosterer has spent on maxi care allow visits in the initial stages of adoption to ensure dog is adjusting well for this reason adopters residing in klang valley are strongly preferred unconditional love to help determine if you and the dog you re interested in are good fit would appreciate it if you could email text brief intro of yourself your experience with dogs if any your household situation what type of home you live in landed or apartment whether you have other family members friends living with you etc and any other pertinent info,224,125,"['there', 'my', 'me', 'behind', 'when', 'he', 'to', 'his', 'me', 'in', 'and', 'would', 'to', 'find', 'me', 'am', 'of', 'who', 'with', 'but', 'not', 'so', 'with', 'to', 'around', 'in', 'would', 'be', 'for', 'me', 'to', 'be', 'for', 'who', 'can', 'of', 'would', 'be', 'and', 'during', 'any', 'for', 'my', 'for', 'no', 'up', 'etc', 'of', 'to', 'and', 'the', 'has', 'on', 'in', 'the', 'of', 'to', 'is', 'well', 'for', 'this', 'in', 'are', 'to', 'if', 'you', 'and', 'the', 'you', 're', 'in', 'are', 'would', 'it', 'if', 'you', 'could', 'of', 'yourself', 'your', 'with', 'if', 'any', 'your', 'what', 'of', 'you', 'in', 'or', 'whether', 'you', 'have', 'other', 'with', 'you', 'etc', 'and', 'any', 'other']","['hey', 'maximillian', 'maxi', 'previous', 'owner', 'left', 'returned', 'home', 'country', 'luckily', 'nice', 'neighbour', 'took', 'like', 'good', 'home', 'really', 'like', 'people', 'big', 'lug', 'love', 'enjoys', 'pats', 'really', 'good', 'female', 'dogs', 'good', 'males', 'spacious', 'compound', 'run', 'great', 'strapping', 'young', 'lad', 'like', 'love', 'taken', 'daily', 'walks', 'experienced', 'owner', 'handle', '40kg', 'excited', 'dog', 'ideal', 'oh', 'really', 'good', 'car', 'rides', 'takers', 'handsome', 'mug', 'conditions', 'adoption', 'unnecessary', 'tying', 'caging', 'maintain', 'medical', 'needs', 'vaccinations', 'deworming', 'heartworm', 'prevention', 'adoption', 'fee', 'rm', 'cover', 'neutering', 'cost', 'partially', 'cover', 'cost', 'fosterer', 'spent', 'maxi', 'care', 'allow', 'visits', 'initial', 'stages', 'adoption', 'ensure', 'dog', 'adjusting', 'reason', 'adopters', 'residing', 'klang', 'valley', 'strongly', 'preferred', 'unconditional', 'love', 'help', 'determine', 'dog', 'interested', 'good', 'fit', 'appreciate', 'email', 'text', 'brief', 'intro', 'experience', 'dogs', 'household', 'situation', 'type', 'home', 'live', 'landed', 'apartment', 'family', 'members', 'friends', 'living', 'pertinent', 'info']",maxi,3,1,3,1,2,1,0.0004806391370948404

In october she was found with an injured leg, so we took her to the veterinary. Her leg is healed very well, she now just has to build up leg muscles again, because she did not use this leg for about 2 weeks - best way to train is to play ;) She is well socialized: - loves humans: loves to be petted, likes to give kisses nose to nose, is cuddling and talking - very patient (had to take a lot of medicines and still loves me ;) - not afraid of noises - using litter box perfectly We can not keep her, so we needed to put her back in the compound, when the leg had healed. Update 6th Nov : Bobo has developed some skin problems, it turned out to be a fungus called ""ringworm"". She is treated with medicine against it. Bobo received her first vacination yesterday. She is back in the compound, where the guards are caring for the cats, they are providing food and fresh water. There is also another cat in that age, certainly Bobos sibling. And there is a highly pregnant cat around too... Will check her status every now and then... Update .16 Bobo definitly lost weight - she has grown so nice under our care :( Maybe loss of appetite because of medicine or she does not get enough food...she is the smallest cat around! Still hoping to be adopted... Update 17th November: The skinproblems are gone XD, hair is growing back very fast! She needs to take pills for 6 more days and get powdered 2 more weeks to really get rid of the fungus. Great recovery, tough girl! She is always around the guardhouse, when I visit. As well as her sister, a beauty in white and orange (see photo below and further profile). She is always coming to me too :). They are very different in character, but I think they are a good couple! Can be adopted together ;) Both are so friendly, bonded to humans and love to be petted! But definivly too skinny... I hope to find a serious adopter who will give her a nice home, love and a healthy life with good cat food, prevention of ticks, fleas and worms, medical attention if needed in future and after all a friend to play with! She should be further vaccinated and neutered.

He wears a very dirty blue collar, with no I.D tag. According to those shop owners and some workers there, he has been wandering around the area for the past 2 days. Looked very hungry so we tried feeding him some corn that i had bought, but he was very timid, he will not approach the food if we put the it on our palm, so we leave it on the floor and move away, and he ate them. When people go near him, he will run away too. There are many cars in that area, he can get knock down very easily. We managed to get him and send him to a dog shelter in Cheras. He is not aggressive at all, looks timid and insecure and did not make any noise (no barking).

Please read on for more details about us! :) ** ------------------------------------------------------------- Introducing handsome little Demetrius! ♥ Male kitten, 4 1/2 months old. Brother to Florentino (Profile: ) ♥ A softie, Demetri has his moments of interest in play but mostly prefers a good cuddle and climbing over laps (he can fall asleep barely seconds after cuddling!). He has the loudest purr too. ♥ Demetri loves people and is easy with other cats (he will adjust fast as long as they're not aggressive towards him) - he will also be the first to explore any new environment or say hello to our vets / visitors. ♥ Demetri will do wonderful in a home where he'll receive lots of petting and affection. He's gentle when he plays and never uses his claws - hence mature children or even babies will make wonderful sidekicks! ♥ Demetri is on the road to recovery from a mild case of flu and is otherwise healthy. He has been dewormed, deflead and is very clever with the litter box. Prefers wet food over dry (although not a picky eater). ***PLEASE READ (Note for adopters)***: ○ Demetri must be kept % indoors for his own safety.

She was then rescued by a guy that lived in the ground floor (while I live in 7th floor). After around a month I didn't see her, she suddenly came to me when I was waiting for the lift in the ground floor. I just played with her for a minute and then leave because I think she was still belong to the guy (but the fact is that all the kittens was already released by him). The next morning I found her in front of my door and then she directly ran into my unit, until now I don't know how can she reached the 7th floor and found my unit but I decided to keep her with me. She is a very active and playful kitten. She has a beautiful pattern around her face that makes her looks so pretty! She is okay with warm water so its not difficult to bath her. Sometimes she can become so spoiled and demanding for me to pet her until she fell asleep (if I didn't do it she will keep chasing me). I like her and want to keep her, but unfortunately I have to move and my new owner didn't allowed me to keep a cat in the unit.

They are approximately 7 weeks old and have completed the 1st round of vaccination & deworming. They have been treated with Frontline Spot-On so they are free from fleas & mites. They must be adopted as a PAIR and be equally loved. Adoption fee of RM is for both kittens to help cover their vaccination, deworming and flea treatment costs. Adopters will receive kittens' vaccination cards provided by the vet. Potential adopters must allow them to roam freely INDOORS, no roaming outdoors and commit to spay them by June . Adopters must also be willing to take the time to help them adjust to their new home. Most importantly, Pumpkin & Munchkin must be treated as Family. Owning a pet is a lifelong commitment. Please contact me ONLY if you can adopt them as a PAIR. Thank you in advance for your interest. UPDATE 31 Jan : There has been overwhelming response to adopt Pumpkin & Munchkin. Kindly note that just because you want to adopt them does not mean that I will give them to you.

She knows how to inhibit herself however and understands a simple firm ""no"" in such circumstances. - Meshira gets along with other sociable / aloof adult cats (those that aren't aggressive) and kittens. She can adjust to dogs as well. Territorial or aggressive adult cats are a big no. - Meshira has been vaccinated, dewormed and spayed. She's not at all fussy about food and is good with the litter box. *** Note For Potential Adopters (PLEASE READ) *** - Meshira ""nips"" as a show of affection hence adult owners or homes with older children preferred (seasoned cat people). - She needs a % indoor home. No apartments (unless you have maintained a cat-safe environment for many years). - Premium diet must be maintained (no Whiskas, Friskies, etc).

Even owned dogs are also often caught, and the owners are not aware for it. Those wishing to adopt this pet from Klang Dog Pound, please follow the procedures below: 1. Drive to Pusat Kurungan Haiwan Lebuh Sultan Muhammad Kawasan Perindustrian Bandar Sultan Sulaiman Pelabuhan Klang Tel : (For Sat & Sun, opening hours are 8am - 12pm) 2. Secure a Borang Permohonan Tuntutan Anjing, Selepas Tempoh 7 hari. Complete it & ensure it is endorsed by the relevant officier & stamped with relevant chop. 3.

He was soaking wet, shivering, full of worms and with a snapped back leg (it stuck out at right angles to his body). It looks to me like somebody stamped on him, whether accidentally or on purpose I don't know. He was too cute to leave sitting there. I took him to the office, and we all nurtured him back to health. For a while we thought his leg might need to be amputated, but he quickly sorted himself out, with a little help from the vet and a lot of love from everybody in the office. Now he's a healthy happy kitten, with insane amounts of energy. He's still a little bit wonky when he runs and pounces, but basically he's % tip top. He's very affectionate, loves people, hates being alone. He's a real lap cat who also loves nothing more than riding round on my shoulders, falling asleep on people and stopping us from doing work. Anything that moves is chased, he'll be a great mouse/cockroach killer. He's fun to play with. He also likes being around other cats. He can be a bit naughty, but is cute enough to get away with it, and he's only young. He's completely house trained, he uses the litter tray (he's most particular about this, was the easiest cat to train I ever had). Sadly he lives in a place of work, where we can't give him enough attention because we're all busy (basically watching him play is a massive time waster for all of us, a great excuse not to work, but). Also, since the office is empty at night he gets lonely and howls. He really needs a loving home, where he can sleep indoors where people are. I wish I could keep him, but it's not fair to Wonky. We're going to get him neutered and vaccinated this week. Please give a call if you want a loving furball in your life. Only nice people who can give him a loving home need apply.

SHe loves to sit on your lap and look at you. I get the feeling she is genuinely very grateful for getting a second chance in life! Because she has touched our hearts so much, we are looking for an extra special home where she will get special care and attention. Because her sight is affected and she can't always judge distances, we would like her to go to a home where she will be kept as an indoor cat. This is very important. Other than this requirement, she would be happy with adults and children alike, and is happy to approach other cats too. As she will be an indoor cat it would be nice for her to go to a home with another cat so that she has some company whilst her human friends are out and about! It's always good to have two kittens together as they really do enjoy the company of their own species. Kayama has had her first vaccination and has been flea treated and dewormed. She is also litter trained but as with all kittens you will need to be patient as accidents can happen :) In adopting her you agree to make sure she is spayed at 6 months of age to prevent unwanted kittens, and also to keep us updated of her progress. Remember, cats can live around 20 years so in taking on Kayama you must be prepared to look after her for the rest of her life (including being able to pay vet bills as and when necessary). This is a serious commitment and only serious potential owners will be considered. Minimum adoption fee is RM. Any more than this would be greatly appreciated as we have spent over RM getting her well and healthy so any contribution enables us to continue on doing rescue and fostering work. If you would like to visit Kayama, she is living with us in Petaling Jaya so please do get in touch and we'll arrange to meet!",79db05f63,3.0,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,125,1,0,300,kayama if you are

However, we have no choice but to re-home Dodi because due to our careers, my wife and I are planning to start life anew overseas in a few months. Furthermore, recently the management of my condo have started to pressure the residents about keeping pets and I am concerned that it is only a matter of time before Dodi can no longer stay in my apartment :( If you are interested to adopt Dodi, we would like to meet and interview you first.

Both of them loves to climb trees and are very eager to their daily morning milk. They are really active and they really do make you smile when looking at them. Both of them are toilet-trained (they use the sand). Hope they will be adopted together, it'll be cruel to separate the siblings. I would rather not give them away but I have 3 other adult cats at home and these kittens are giving them a huge amount of stress.

Timtams are now part of a loving family of parents +3kids+a maid and loving the wonderful corner house with grass in the compound! ----- TimTams (one is Tim, one is Tam)- to make it easier to call them! Potential adopters should be able to commit to: 1) walking the dogs 2x a day (or keep them in secured bungalow/semi-d/corner house with vast area to roam, as they love running and playing) 2) spend time playing with them (they're still quite young, and will whine for attention unless given regular affection-time with keeper) 3) give fresh water daily & proper food (they eat kibbles) 4) keep shoes in proper shoe cabinet cos one of them is still displaying puppy behaviour of chewing shoes or moving them around (unless he gets adequate exercise and attention) They appear to be brothers, and was roaming Ara Damansara area when found. Plus points about these dogs: 1) trainable: know how to sit/shakehand/come 2) loves children and will play with kids - excellent FAMILY PETs! 3) chase cats (but don't attack them) 4) will bark at strangers - good alert dogs! 5) friendly to keeper and friends 6) great with older folks because of gentle nature - makes excellent FAMIlY PETs! 7) get along with other dogs, even male dogs (possibly because not fully sexually mature and also very gentle + playful in nature), so can join family with existing dogs. NOTE: Will only entertain genuine adopters who'd take either one or both dogs as family pets. They get along well with other dogs.

Message from Ex-foster mummy: With a heavy heart I must find her a good home where she is allowed to be dog and be happy. She has been through a lot, I only wish the best for her. Will care for her till she get a home. Terms and Condition: There will be an Adoption fee, PM me and we'll go through a interview process, if successful home visit must be allowed before handing over the dog. Bi-monthly home visit to check up on the dog. Health status: Mild Hip Dysplasia, other than that overall healthy spayed, vaccinated. Location: currently in Ipoh (grandma's house) Summary: I’m Freya Tumbleweed a 7 year old Belgian Shepherd Malinois. I was previously a skinny 13kgs, malnourished abandoned dog found on the streets in Klang until a kind hearted Samaritan found me and posted up about me on Facebook requesting for help. Foster mummy’s friend responded and took me to a vet and a couple of days I was handed over to my foster mummy. I was diagnosed with HeartWorm thankfully it was only Stage 1, I was put on a safer treatment a combination of Doxycycline and HeartGard (Ivermectin) for 6 months. I stayed in foster mummy’s care for close to a year, making sure I was totally recovered and was then send for spaying, I was suspected to be used for breeding. I couldn’t stay too long at foster mummy’s house mainly it was because I couldn’t get along with 2 out of 4 dogs that live there and I had to stay indoors leashed because of foster mummy’s cats safety ( I still had my daily twice a day walks though) and foster mummy and family felt bad for me. On the 11th of November I was send to my foster mummy’s ( now ex-foster mummy) grandma’s house which is 2 hours away since they were looking for another dog to help watch over the house. I managed to adapt myself to my new environment pretty quick. Unfortunately on the 14th of December, I managed to escape the backyard fence through a hole I managed to find and escape to find my friend ( nobody was at home except Grandma). Grandma spotted me and wanted to bring me back, I got a little overzealous over grandma trying to leash me I accidentally caused my grandma to fall (she is in recovery but slow). Grandma now prefers I go back with Ex-foster mummy and other family agree for the sake of her safety. Ex-foster mummy says I’m overall a good/watch dog but I get overzealous at times and I like to jump hug people that is kind of a problem. Long story short Ex-foster mummy is now looking at finding me a new home that has a nice size compound and family that will give me the LOVE/ATTENTION/DISCIPLINE/EXERCISE I need. I get on well in general with other dogs provided they are nice and friendly; I DON’T do well with AGGRESSIVE/CRAZY/DOMINANT DOGS. I will definitely love my humans maybe a tad bit too much, I get along with children (preferably 10 years old and above). I have mild Hip Dysplasia, I will need to take Glucosamine daily.

Her favourites here are our make-shift cardboard tunnels and string toys / balls.

She will grow into a typical lap-cat: loves chest-snuggles and especially having her head / ears rubbed as she nuzzles herself against us to sleep. She playbites but not roughly - she understands the difference between toys and human fingers although she does sometimes get over-excited. ♥ Kiseki has been treated against worms, parasites as well as tested negative against several viruses. She is very clever with the litter-box and is not fussy over food - still too young to be vaccinated. --------------------------------------------------------------- ***PLEASE READ (NOTE FOR ADOPTERS)***: ○ Kiseki must be kept INDOORS at all times (apartments should be cat-proof). ○ She MUST be spayed at the right age (there are far too many homeless kittens like her out there). ○ Premium food feeding only (no Whiskas, Friskies etc).

That dog was clean... No sign of it like it was a stray dog... Then i asked around... They saw someone, an Indian guy, with motorcycle, dump the dog near the main street... I got the dog safely to my house, put it in the cage... Just so you know, i'm a Malay... Have more than 23 cats in my care... I couldn't afford to care for a dog because of few difficulties..

We recently took him home from the SPCA as an addition to our family but unfortunately, he's been clashing with our resident dog, Sunshine! They just do NOT get along, which is unfortunate as Norman is a great little dog on his own. Norman would be perfect in a one-dog household. He's loving, smart and LOVELY with kids. Very friendly with people and other dogs - except ours! Actually, our first dog is the one with the territorial issues. Norman is already neutered, housetrained and learning his commands quickly. He's a 2.5 year old schnauzer-poodle mix. He has been vaccinated and dewormed, I have also had my vet examine him (all at great expense) - he is in perfect health. I have also had him tested for heartworms - and he is negative and has been given a yearly heartworm vaccination. Please get in touch if you'd like to adopt him. I do not want to send him back to the SPCA if I can help it, but my family and Sunshine cannot put up with the dog-fights and chaos in our home (the dogs live indoors) for much longer. It's been 2 weeks since we brought him home and it's just not working out. I think Norman would be perfect for you if you don't already have a dog in your home. Though I do not think the fault lies entirely with Norman, our other dog was here first! Please sms me ONLY if you are serious and willing to take him on soon, and I will call you back.

I guess Brave was not meant to end his life there, he managed to meow softly which somehow caught my attention. I quickly picked him up and was shocked to see that Brave was so skinny and could barely walk. Brave's body was so cold and his eyes were half opened. Without any hesitation, I used a thick towel to wrap him up and tried to hand feed him with some wetfood,he refused to eat, fed him with some milk and water, he refused to drink, Brave was simply too weak to eat and drink. Brave was infected by a virus similar to that of parvo virus in a dog. That night, Brave was just lying and closed his eyes with heavy breath and i thought that he might not be able to make it to the next day. However, in the middle of the night, i heard a soft meow, it was Brave ! he was meowing to me ! he managed to raise up his little head eventhough he still could not stand up and walk. Immediately, i fed him some milk and water and he drank ! i monitored Brave's condition throughout the night (he was having severe diarrhea as well) and rushed him to the vet, Dr. Tan (2nd chance panel vet) the next morning. Dr. Tan said by looking at Brave's terrible condition and based on her experience, normally kitten infected with this kind of virus and with such a low body temperature as well as severe diarrhea, Brave had a very low chance to pull through. Brave was hospitalised and continue to be monitored and i, already prepared to receive call from the Dr. Tan anytime about the bad news on Brave, However, Brave has such a strong will to live, he began to perk up the next day, he can stand up and walk, he started to eat and drink by himself ! Yesterday, i dropped by at the clinic and Dr. Tan said that Brave's temperature has gone back to normal despite a bit of a diarrhoea. Brave not only ate and drank on his own, he even walked out from the cage and greeted me with a loud meow ! After a while, he started to groom himself ! What a joy! So, this is a wonderful and happy story about Brave and i hope that someone can foster Brave or better still, adopt him ! because Brave definitely deserves to be loved, doesn't he ? I hope that someone is kind enough to foster him. if he is not adopted, at least he is under the good hands of the fosterer and until the time that he is totally recovered and strong enough, i have to put Brave back to his colony. i hope Brave is fit and strong enough to be a community cat at my condo.

Mikey is friendly to human however he is territorial and doesn't enjoy mixing with other dogs/cats. He is a good guard dog and extremely alert. Our preference is for an experienced dog owner without any dogs or pets to adopt Mikey so he can adjust in well. Bull is energetic and athletic thus regular exercise is required. If you are interested, here is our requirement : 1) Adopter must be a Malaysian or a PR. 2) Adopter must be an animal lover and preferably have experience in handling dog. 3) Neutering and vaccination has been done. We will be charging RM which is the total sum of his medical fee. 4) No long hour of caging or tied on leash. 5) Provide necessary medical needs (vaccinations, deworming, flea/tick/heartworm prevention etc.) 6) Adopter must add us on Facebook so we can receive his progress update. 7) We would like to view the condition of your home before deciding. 8)During the initial stage of adoption, allow visitation so we can ensure Mikey is adjusting well to his new environment. For this reason, adopter residing in Klang Valley is highly preferred. 9) Approval for this adoption is only for the successful adopter.

Im begging any kind hearted to adopt them. I really really dont have enough space to keep them as Im staying in small apartment and I already have few kittens to take care. Please please..as long as you can give a proper food n shelter they're all yours and its not necessary that u have to take all 5 of them.

Father was a Ragdoll and mother is an American Curl (given up by previous owners while pregnant). ♥ Louis was the tiniest runt of the litter whom we initially thought wouldn't survive! He had extra time and feeds from us and remarkably within a week, began blooming and catching up. He's still a midget today compared to his siblings! The most independent and inquisitive boy, he loves strokes and being shown around the house. He follows our feet everywhere! Loves sitting on our laps to watch things (whenever he chooses and not while he's busy playing, of course!). ♥ He's already had his first vaccination and deworming. Not fussy about kibble or wet food and is very clever with the litter box! ***IMPORTANT: Note For Potential Adopters*** - Louis must be kept INDOORS at all times. Apartments must be cat-safe. - He's been raised since birth on a grain-free healthy diet and this must be maintained (no Whiskas, Friskies, etc). Feel free to inquire if unsure, this is for any cat's long term well being. - Neutering is COMPULSORY and we will reject anyone who doesn't fit this requirement.

They have to be adopted together as a pair because they are familiar with each other. The reason being is because I am moving away soon and my new place is shared with other people and I think does not allow pets. Another reason is financial reason. I might not be able to afford their medical expenses in the future so if anything, I will have difficulty to pay. The cats are Hinata and Mimi. Both are already neutered and toilet trained so can be kept inside. Or outside if you'd like because they like to wander around. Just make sure the neighbourhood is safe enough. Hinata - Female, Tortoiseshell, about 2 years old. Shy and timid around strangers but once she is familiar with you, she'll be very relaxed and lazy. Mimi - Female, Calico, about 4 years old. Jumpy and alert. Clingy and get attached with you very well when she knows you.

She will need lots of attenion as she seeks comfort with people often. ♥ This girl is very clever with her little-box and eats her kibble independantly. She has been dewormed (still too young to be vaccinated) and is in good health. ***[IMPORTANT] Note for potential adopters*** ○ Jamaica must be kept % indoors for her own safety.

He enjoys climbing up onto your shoulder to sniffle your hair and nibble your ear. He grew up with 4 bigger brothers and could not compete with them for milk and space while baby. So he was always the smallest and sickly one. His right eye still looks wonky due to his sickly babyhood. The vet says that he might out grow it as he matures. But if not, it can be corrected (but not necessary). But he is healthy and active now in spite of his wonky right eye. In fact, to make up for his small size, he has grown a big ""I-can-do-it"" attitude and is often the leader of his bigger brothers showing them new places to explore and new games to play. And because of his sickly babyhood, he had developed a very positive outlook in life - whatever happens he will still go, ""Yay! Happy, happy."" He is a well-socialized intelligent kitty because he got the double privilege of growing up with brothers and a mother cat and got regular daily hand-feeding by various kind people since babyhood. So he gets along cheerfully with cats and humans. He loves to play with the kids in the neighbourhood. Born on 15 Nov , he is brother to Caramel and Muffin: And brother to Cupcake and Cookie: It would be ideal if he could be adopted together with Cupcake and Cookie because they are now very close to each other.

She was nearly run down by a vehicles while i had my breakfast and since it is not safe for her to be on the street i decided to foster her while looking for potential adopter.

On the 4th day i noticed the female cat is away for a longer period than usual. As i was away yesterday, i told my brother to keep a lookout for the female cat and it seems she hasnt returned since last night. They have been crying for quite a while and I think they're just hungry. In the mean time, we're taking care of these kittens, feeding it with milk replacement. Appreciate if some kind soul out there would adopt/foster these kittens, preferably someone with a mother cat who just gave birth and wouldnt mind additional members to the family.

He follows what his brother does all the time. So, when he sees that fluffers and i are having fun together, he loosens up and joins in. He loses his fear when he is together with fluffers, separate them and his fears return. If you are looking for INDOOR cats and don't mind their high energy play, you can call me at . Adopter must be a very patient person as Cocochino will not be immediately friendly, must be willing to put in effort to build a relationship with these boys, a true cat lover. The succesful adopter will have to reimburse me for Mr Fluffers and Cocochino's neutering and vaccinations at which point i will hand over their medical booklets. This means the adopter must pay me back for what i have spent on their neutering and vaccinations. I don't make a profit. They have received their first and second vaccinations.

They were rescued from an irresponsible breeders who force mama Snowy to breed for their greed to sell off the puppies at a pasar malam. Mama Snowy is now adopted by a super nice woman who loves her to bits! Now Snowy Girl is looking for her forever home. Her wish is simple - she just wants someone to love her. Besides feeding her, playing w her, walking her, bathe her etc etc etc hahaaa Anyways, Snowy Girl is one happy playful puppy. She has a very shaggy fur on top but just like her mom, I think it is due to lack of nutrition coz those irresponsible people didn't feed them with good food. Heck, they only fed them once every alternate days!!!!! Oh, let's get back to the fur part. Her fur is quite shaggy on top and on her sides, it looks like its been trimmed nicely but that is how her fur grows. Very special indeed. She will grow to be medium size but quite leggy coz mama Snowy is quite leggy too. Snowy Girl is great w children and is full of love and smiles.

He had 80% burns...all the way on his anus, feet and paws. Despite having been severely injured by a human, he seems to still have room to allow a human into his kitty space - very friendly and affectionate towards humans. IF YOU are the type who love a cat regardless of their breed or color of their fur or lack of fur, this cat would make a wonderful companion for you. He has been with us for 1 month and his wound has healed. I don't know if all the fur will grow back. He has a lovely disposition, and runs to you when he's called. Looking for human who's ready for a committed mutual companionship. 4. She makes a more pleasant and compatible companion than many humans out there! NOTE: She is still a cat - hence, do not leave food unattended. She goes into her cage on her own to sleep. Now that she's at PAWS the new owner can refresh her memory by training her to go to her cage and sit before putting her food down. She has already adapted very well with human house rules.

That’s because when I was 3 months old, I fell into a drain and couldn’t get out. I was wet, dirty, miserable and scared. Then a kind lady came and hauled me out of the drain by the scruff of my neck, took me home and cleaned me up. She took me to the vet where I had to have a jab and some medication. I was saved from sure death! Now I’m neutred, have all my 3 vaccination jabs, am healthy and quite cute & pretty. I’m now about 6 months old, but it seems I won’t be a very big dog. My Mummy says I keep growing long rather than tall & big. It’s okay, I don’t mind being a smallish dog. It makes it easy for me to move around the place. Because I’ve been so lucky to be saved, I’m full of glee and energy. You should see me run – I’m fast! I love playing with soft toys. I can sit, roll, paw & shake, and fetch – well, most of the time, I can. I love car rides & bicycle rides. I used to sit in the bicycle basket, but now I’m getting too big for it!

Now I'm done with my studies and currently staying at my parents home. However my little brother is allergic to cat fur. My parents didn't allowed me to keep Kenzo due to my little brother condition. Hence I'm looking for a good & kind-hearted soul that willing to adopt my baby. He deserve a better home. Upon adoption, I will give the adopter the litterbox, water & food bowl, remaining cat litter & kibbles, as well as carrier. Kenzo, 1 years ++ male, dewormed, indoor cat, vaccinated at gov vet (will provide the vaccination certificate upon adoption), not yet castrated. He dislikes to be trapped in cage/carrier or else he will meow, whine or growl incessantly. He also terrified of riding in the car, he seems to be fear & not enjoy the experience. Kenzo is loving, funny and super friendly boy. He is a clingy & spoilt cat with adorable attitude. Active and playful but will collapse after 5-10mins of playing, maybe because he is kinda fat. He has a weird habit of grinding his teeth which is cuteeeee that might fix your mood swing. Litter trained. His light blue eyes are very captivating and could melt your heart instantly. Adopters must agree to keep him indoors or in a secure yard & not to put him in cage unless it's for quarantine/ transportation. Adoption fee RM50 is to make sure new owner is serious to take care of him. Looking for cat lover that can give he a forever home where he deserves more love, care and attention.

We adopted him from a breeder (in other worda bought him) and have been taking care of him since he is 4 months old. He's been completely vaccinated (incl feline-leukemia), dewormed and spayed. Aboo is a house-cat but is allowed to go out once in a while. He's litter trained and very adaptable to the type of litter used (clumping clay, crystal, Okoplus). Food wise, he's not at all a picky eater but we feed him with either Royal Canin or LV fit 31.

I don't normally say mean things, but I hope that his owners rot in hell for abandoning him, for letting him suffer physical and mental stress of living on the streets and fending for himself, for being knocked down by a car and injuring his leg and for being caught by the dog catchers! ******************* /14 This is Simba. He was abandoned by his owners when they shifted out of their house. They just threw him out on the streets. The poor boy waited for them to come back for him and refused to move from that road eventhough it was a very busy road. The neighbours in the area started feeding him and they tried to catch him several times. But he would always evade them. Sometime last week, he was hit by a car and his front leg was injured. Again the people that were feeding him tried to catch him but to no avail. And then one idiotic and heartless neighbour decided to report him to the council (saying that he was a dangerous dog although he kept to himself and was just waiting for his family) and poor Simba got caught. The people feeding him called me and asked me to help get him out. Thankfully I managed to claim him back from the council. But Simba was petrified when we went to get him out. He couldn't move. He was frozen with fear. There were lots of other dogs there that had been caught and I know that this is the case with all the council pounds. I wish I could have taken them all, but I couldn't... :( It took us quite a while to finally get him out but we finally succeeded. We brought him back to my place and it took over an hour before he finally realised that he was safe. He had a good sleep, probably the first time he slept peacefully since he was abandoned. He will be going to vet today and I would be grateful if one of you could help foster him while he recovers from his injury, and while I look for a new forever home for him. He will not do well being boarded as he is quite a timid dog... We could look after him ourselves but we already have way too many animals... Please call me if you can help foster this lovely boy. I will take care of all medical expenses and food bills etc. I just need a home environment where he can rest and regain his faith in humans. Or better still, if you can give him a forever home that he deserves, that will be even better. Please SMS or WhatsApp me at if you can either foster or adopt Simba. If you can't, please help share this so that Simba will have a better chance of getting a home. TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR ADOPTION: 1. Must not be caged or chained unnecessarily. 2. Must be given clean shelter from the heat and rain. 3. Must be fed proper food and be given access to water at all times. 4. Must be given medical care and attention when necessary. 5. Will only be released to the adopter after neutering. ********************** PS: If you ever lose your dog, please call all the nearby councils and insist that you want to go and check their pounds cause sometimes they will just say that they didn't catch any dogs in a particular area. Your dog could be waiting for you helplessly! And you should check immediately on the day you lost the dog and the subsequent days after that.

neutered today and will be ready to go to his new family in week or so update 14 simba has had bath and is looking quite handsome now and he has finally brought his tail out from between his legs and is even wagging his tail when we picked simba up he was really so scared and frightened that his tail was stuck between his legs poor thing don normally say mean things but hope that his owners rot in hell for abandoning him for letting him suffer physical and mental stress of living on the streets and fending for himself for being knocked down by car and injuring his leg and for being caught by the dog catchers 14 this is simba he was abandoned by his owners when they shifted out of their house they just threw him out on the streets the poor boy waited for them to come back for him and refused to move from that road eventhough it was very busy road the neighbours in the area started feeding him and they tried to catch him several times but he would always evade them sometime last week he was hit by car and his front leg was injured again the people that were feeding him tried to catch him but to no avail and then one idiotic and heartless neighbour decided to report him to the

So everyday I take her to a padang to run. Sometimes she might be hyperactive, jumping on you licking u nonstop etc. 2) She is very attach to People/ Owners. at the same time very playful with other dogs, can mingle well. 3) She will guard you door at night, barks at strangers walking past or walking close. In the morning sometimes she barks at passerby, but most of the day-time she sleeps. 4) Not yet very Obediant but very very trainable (with doggy Treats and Cane, depending on situation). She is trained not to bite shoes already (but sometimes she still flings it around for fun, but wont chew on it). 5) Can understand Simple words like: ""Guana~"", ""Sit/ Sitdown"", ""Hand/ Shakehand"", ""Come"", ""NO!"", ""Da Da Le!!""(Means Beat Beat in Chinese), 6) Will chase cats (Chase Only). Wont bite cats, will only surround/ trap it at a corner and bark at it non stop. Will stop kaciao-ing the cat if you yell ""Guana NOo!!"". The Reason she hate cats is once she got Clawed by a stray cat, at first she wants to make friends with it wagging her tail jumping around her, then CLAWW!!!. Now she hate them species.  The Reasons I am giving her up for adoption. 1) WORK- My working life has increase in activitivities, I have to go outstation or out of country alot more now (for days, weeks, coming project need to leave msia for a month :[ ). No more 9-5 job. Hiah. things Change so suddent. 2) Family- Suddently Parents decided to come back from overseas, and plan to stay in Msia for a long time. So means Garage park one more car= less space for guana to run. And they dont like Dogs, If I am not around they wont walk my dog. Most they did so far is fed her (very reluctantly) when I am not around. They are ok with her(wont hurt or scold her), but I know in their mind they see her as a burden. * What She needs now is Friends. Sometimes I can feel her loneliness. I feel sad. When she has a friend she can play many many hours with it and wont get tired. * Training her with tid bids and snacks are more effective than cane. Cane should only be use as a threatning gesture only. Only use it when she did something very wrong on purpose. * Maybe I am spoiling her too much. Hmmmm. * You can Change name if you like, as she is still young. some commands she still havent fully understand. Sometimes she dosent respond to her own name. * Feel free to take her feeding n drinking bowl, leash, collar and her remaining dog food. Let me know. If u want or dont want the things. * Hopefull I can find a genuine adopter before I leave on a short(9days) outstation trip on the 25th feb. But has to be adopted before 16th march before my taiwan (3weeks)business trip.  I Hope someone will understand my situation as there are so many unprecidented sudden changes in my life lately. I am Sorry to all that is reading this, because I could not continue taking care of her as my work will get even busier in the weeks to come. Hope a Genuine good adopter will take Guana in to their family (prefer people with dog(s) already, I dont want her to be lonely).",de97498e6,13.0,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,200,1,1,0,love guana alot guana

He has green eyes, olive and white fur. Foojooli enjoys naps, cuddles and chats - he is wary of strangers but is very loving once he gets to know someone.

Picasso was being rescued from roadside several months ago, we saw that there's a man stood there kept trying to kick Picasso away, she was just a tiny baby asking for foods that time! We sent her to vet for medical check up and found that she got real severe virus infection on stomach and she had diarrhea for over 2 weeks even after she took medications. Picasso is a big and healthy girl now and she started to really look like a girl..she's independent, smart, active and always love to play with her toys & friends. She loves to play different kind of toys and will never let you down when you get her a new toy - she will play it smartly in front of you.

She was two cars apart from me & I whispered: “Do you need help?” and she came over to me. I took her to my regular vet for checkup. Her skin problem is not contagious but needs a longer time to recover. (demodex) Name : Bailey Age : -+ 1 year old, female. Vaccinated. Neutered. As at Oct About : She knows SIT, STAY, COME, WIPE & Mum-Mum (for food). She does her poo & pee in my balcony instead of inside her cage. She’s a happy & a playful dog. Afraid of human crowd, time is needed to gain her trust again :) Currently, I’m fostering 5 dogs. This has created a strain in my marriage. For those who have been with me for the past few months, I thanked you all from the bottom of my heart. It has been 4 months since Bailey is residing in my regular vet. This has incur much in my financial as I am only a solo rescuer. Help me so that I would be able to continue with my rescue mission. She’s no longer an abandoned dog anymore, she has a name.

I also trim their nails. Their fur is short but silky clean since they are not allowed outdoors. - Mr Stripey has been vaccinated on 18 October (4-in-1, RM50) with a booster vaccination on 15 November (4-in-1, RM50) at a total cost of RM. - Mr Stripey's behaviour is outgoing and affectionate. He would purr happily when held. The adopter must agree to the following conditions: 1) The adopter must be a Malaysian. However, I will consider an expatriate adopter if you can provide assurances for his future when you return to your home country. 2) He must be kept indoors at all times. 3) You should have a cat cage to confine him for the first few weeks to let him feel secure and get used to your home surroundings. 4) Neuter him when he's old enough at 8 months old. 5) Vaccinate him yearly to protect against diseases. 6) Apply spot-on medication (Revolution recommended) monthly to protect against ticks/fleas/ear mites/intestinal worms/heartworms. 7) The RM adoption fee must be paid in full as it will only cover his vaccination cost. Your adoption fee will help the next needy furkid. If Mr Stripey is adopted with his sibling, Mr Fiesty ( ), there would be a 50% reduction on the second adoption fee. 8) It would be appreciated if the adopter is on Facebook so that we can get pictorial updates on Mr Stripey. 9) Please adopt on a weekend as I'm working full-time on weekdays. If you're interested to adopt Mr Stripey, please sent a message (via petfinder.my) and please share about yourself (Malaysian/expatriate? Working/student?), your place (eg If renting, landlord allows pets? If living with family/friends, do they agree to pets?) and your cat ownership experience.

I love snuggling up for cuddles and belly rubs. Canine buddies make me super happy, I really love to play! Like most of my ilk, I'm a clownish doofus ready to amuse you with my silly antics. I'm potty-trained on grass when outdoors and walk nicely on a leash. Please don't tie me up or confine me unnecessarily cos I will protest rather loudly and persistently.

To summarise, my nanny says: I'm ideal for homes that... - have the time and patience to train and supervise a chew-happy pup - have one or more friendly and playful dogs to keep my jolly self company - have a decent-sized chew-proof area to contain me when unsupervised - have humans that can provide me with lots of companionship - elderly folks, work-at-home folks, kids etc. and I'll be a happy chappy! I'm NOT ideal for homes that... - cannot tolerate destructive chewing. - leave me alone for long hours. You won't like what I get up to when bored! - have small, reactive dogs or other small animals. I sometimes get overexcited during play and go into prey mode - I'd prefer to avoid hurting little creatures please :) ================================================== Conditions for adoption: 1. No unnecessary tying/caging up. 2. Maintain medical needs (vaccinations, deworming, flea/tick/heartworm prevention etc.) 3. Adoption fee of RM to cover neutering cost. 4. Allow visits in the initial stages of adoption to ensure dog is adjusting well - for this reason adopters residing in Klang Valley are strongly preferred. 5.

Anyone who is serious about adopting MACO may contact us at . ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- This little boy, Maco was found abandoned at the door front of a kind-hearted lady. He was injured and there were 5 maggots infected wounds on his body. Due to the limited space in the lady's house (as she also home rescued animals she found), she was unable to foster Maco but to passed him to our volunteer to temporary help in fostering and care for him while healing. Maco's wounds were about to recover fully now. But his condition was not well previously as the wounds were badly infected by bacteria and led to canine abscess. After an entire week on antibiotic prescription, the abscess and wounds did not heal.

She and her three kittens need a great chance of living in caring homes. Pepper/Pebbles is a young first-time mother. She had her first litter of three healthy kittens 4 months ago.

Juliane (his owner) took Boy home for the first time, Boy barks. Later then he learns to meow. Other than Boy, there's Kate. She has nerve problem. Her brain deteriorates day by day and now Juliane focus on Kate who needs full attention. Every time Kate gets panic attack, that's when the brain will slowly damage. So the more panic attack Kate gets, the more brain damage she'll suffer. Because of Kate's condition, moreover Kate can't see other cat else she'll start to get panic, Juliane decide to put Boy for adoption. Boy is at my place (Bubu's Shelter) now. Though he's big, he's domesticate. When he bonds with you, he'll start suckle your palm. That's how he shows affection. I've train him not to play with human hands, but sometimes he does. But he's a fast learner, so if you show that you're angry when he bites your hand or feet, he'll understand his mistake and stop doing it. So whenever he's hyper, make sure you have toys for him.

feline from the day rescued ______________________________________________ purpose of adoption fee includes part of the cost for spaying neutering fee rm feline vaccinations rm 35 each medical bills when we first rescued the feline to allow us to continue our rescue efforts and to help cover the medical and food cost _____________________________________________ other remarks if you are interested in giving home to these lovely felines kindly contact the above but before that please do consider the responsibilities of being an owner and decide only after serious consideration there is no point in wanting these kitties out of impulse and then deciding to abandon or give them away later animals have feelings too and the right thing to do is to treat them as part of the family and not just as pet together we can make this world better place for all living things and help save lives interested parties please contact us by text whatsapp call facebook private message email and you will need to fill out an adoption form for us any details about yourselves and your experience with cats will be greatly appreciated please don let this put you off as we did not have any prior experience with cats either it is something that can be learnt gradually over time and it will evolve into wonderful two way relationship the important thing is to look at them as part of our loved ones and not just another animal where there is love relationship and trust will grow please help us to continue helping other abandoned and stray animals,584,309,"['for', 'or', 'further', 'please',

She is sadly Heartworm positive and will be treated for it..She was officially fostered on the 13th of Feb and will be under the care of a very kind samaritan for 2 months. We hope a suitable person would come forward to welcome her with open arms with a forever home..we know she is at that age but has been through a lot. Can you imagine having a choke collar on yourself, your whole life? See the 'rafia' tied on her choke collar? Yes, I got it snipped off and hopefully the fosterer would be able to get her choke collar off. What is wrong with human beings! The Starbucks trip could wait, Starbucks won't go anywhere. Even if one Starbucks gets demolished, more would appear..But there are billions of animals in need and there will always be one buddy or clara or we will call her every loving name in the entire world!..Just like there is only one of us out of the billions of people out there. If you want a dog that is just there as an accessory or if you just want a dog that is healthy, I guess you don't have to read further but I hope the least you could do is place yourself in her shoes and share about her. I been asked if her chances of being adopted is high. I don't have a crystal ball people, I'm not God either so your question is bizarre to me, but as bleak as it may seem to many of you, I want to remain hopeful that a responsible and caring adopter would come forward wanting to care for her like a child who would stand by their elderly parent with ailments. Buddy was sent to me I believe..God had a task for me on that day. That day where a man cockily rang the bell and asked me to place water for the dog. Of course I would though I was put off by him. Man claimed dog followed him from the bus stop but he was reluctant to stay even for one minute with the dog while I gathered the food, the water? Doesn't click. Dog wanders up and down..people, hah, people were so unkind in general. I could go 'excuse me sir, excuse me, excuse me maam' and what? They just ignored me. To top it off, employer appeared displeased with the dog's presence, but adviced on placing food at the bus stop and just letting her wander off. If one knows me well enough, such 'advices' goes into into my left ear, out through my right ear. I made calls in secrecy. Managed to find a neighbour of this kind couple who housed her for two nights. 8 am the next day, I had to collect her. Would be at work with me but I was only allowed to place her outside of the clinic (yup, I work in an animal clinic indeed). Imagine the scorching heat, imagine the thunder, the rain and I couldn't. Mind you, couldn't even board her. Not because I had no money. I was simply not allowed to. As shitty as that was, good thing, I went by what I stood for and I wasn't a moron to listen to such advices. I've my own personal values. I would have slept with her outside of the clinic at night if that was what it took even because no way was I going to leave her to fend for herself. Thankfully a kind lady contacted me through the internet and agreed to foster her for 2 months. So again fellow Malaysians or expats or people holidaying here etc, before you go for your next Starbucks fix or debating on what clothes to buy, please take a moment and reflect on this. The fosterer and me are really hoping we could find a suitable person to give her a permanent home...We want the end of her days to be filled with love, compassion... If you are that person, please contact me Yasmin at. Its best for you to sms me first because I work such long hours. More pictures and any necessary updates will be provided. We can't predict what will happen within this two month period but..we do need fosterers as a back up.. So please, we could end up like Clara..alone, lost, left to wander about when we're old, hoping for the mercy of another human being. Think about it. Someday, we could be sitting outside of Starbucks, begging for dough..from the outside, looking in and all of the 'too caught up with the Starbucks buzz' people who reminded you of yourself when you were younger would all turn a blind eye at you and hey, remember back then that dog you didn't want to give your time for? Reality would blow you real hard when you see a dog wandering on the streets, comforting you. Just think about it. Its no Hollywood script. Its reality. Think about it. If what I just wrote does hit you somewhere, then hit me up. Otherwise, just turn the page.

Bailey was abandoned by her mummy along with her brother below the apartment. The brother was then taken away by some people nearby but left bailey all by herself. I decided to adopt her to keep my dog AJ. We brought her to the vet to checked and for vaccination. Bailey was not really fond of AJ. Bailey grew slightly taller than AJ and very muscular looking.

Even owned dogs are also often caught, and the owners are not aware for it. Those wishing to adopt this pet from Klang Dog Pound, please follow the procedures below: 1. Drive to Pusat Kurungan Haiwan Lebuh Sultan Muhammad Kawasan Perindustrian Bandar Sultan Sulaiman Pelabuhan Klang Tel : (For Sat & Sun, opening hours are 8am - 12pm) 2. Secure a Borang Permohonan Tuntutan Anjing, Selepas Tempoh 7 hari. Complete it & ensure it is endorsed by the relevant officier & stamped with relevant chop. 3. Provide a photostated copy of your Identification Card or Passport with each application * policies & requirements stiffen day by day * Advisable to provide a copy of IC/Passport per application (Just in case) * Secure extra application if there is any inkling of additional adoption. * Don't expect any leniency (Even we committee members, slaves & beggars don't have any unless OK by big guy) 4.

They lived for months with almost zero outside world or human contact, and this eventually took a toll on them. ♥ Both siblings were later rescued (with mange, fleas, and all sorts of physical problems). Worse yet, their spirits had been killed and they had little to no trust towards humans. -------------------------------------------------- Good news though!! ♥ Prada and Louis have been under proper foster care and have already made TREMENDOUS progress! ♥ Louis is absolutely friendly (see pics of him below), while Prada is getting extremely curious and edging closer to us day by day. ♥ Prada & Louis are also VERY alert, will bark and make good watch-dogs (not guard-dogs). At other times they have very laid back temperaments. ♥ Both Prada and Louis are looking for understanding and loving new families who can show them the love and life that they lost as puppies, to help them break out of their past endurance entirely. -------------------------------------------------- Please read (Note for Adopters): - Prada and Louis should not be leashed or caged (unless it's for temporary needs).

A friend was walking his dogs when they suddenly became excited outside an apartment complex and sniffed out a shoe box. Inside the shoe box was little Charlie! He was about 6 weeks old then, emaciated and dehydrated, just a scrap of skin and bones. He had a bad tummy virus but survived it after two weeks of antibiotics. Now he needs a permanent home! Charlie is very active, playful, and affectionate. He likes playing with other cats and sitting on people's laps. He uses his litterbox without fail. Charlie is best suited for indoor living, free-roaming inside a house or apartment. Adoption Procedure: - We'll have a chat and see if you and Charlie are suitable for each other. Then you can meet and see if you get along :) - Successful adopter will then have to meet us at my vet in order to get the little tyke vaccinated. Then your new family member is yours to take home and love forever. - Cost of vaccinations and neutering to be borne by adopter. I am primarily an independent rescuer/fosterer. My funds are extremely limited. - I do appreciate occasional updates and photos after a successful adoption! Vaccinations and neutering at 6 months of age are COMPULSORY for adoption. There are already too many stray homeless animals starving and suffering in the streets.. Look how Charlie started out! Please don't breed. When you want more pets, you can always ADOPT from a shelter. No cage confinement please, except in incidences of illness or injury.

It was raining heavily and the little kitten was all wet and hungry. I waited for hours to see any sign of the mother cat but there is none. So I believe that the little kitten is abandoned by the mother cat. Anyway, I managed to catch the little kitten and currently he/she is in the cage. I am still unable to hold the little kitten as he/she is still afraid of human contact. So, I am unable to know the little kitten's gender yet. My hunch is that the little kitten is a female :) I am looking for any potential adopter who is willing and kind enough to adopt this little kitten. The potential adopter has to be very patience with this little kitten as he/she is afraid of human. I believe that with tender loving care and patience, the little kitten will turn out to be a wonderful companion for the potential adopter. So, if any of the genuine adopter who is willing and able to care for this little kitten, please give me a call . Thank you. 1/3/16 Its been a week since I rescued this kitten and I found out that she's really a female and so I named her ABBIE. She's still wary of strangers but she's comfortable with me to the extend that she allows me to carry her on my lap and clip her nails.

My friends from the neigbourhood and I decided to check him out after hearing his cry for a couple of days and noticed that he was an abandoned puppy with serious injuries. We quickly raised funds ourselves and sent him to the vet for operations. Now, he is as healthy and lively as any other puppy. Soon after he was healed, we put his up for adoption as my friend's parents strongly against her keeping ""Oreo"" as pet. Finally, a kind lady adopted ""Oreo"" but only for 2 weeks. She surrendered Oreo to us saying the dog is just not right for her and Oreo has lost because she was careless . Finally my friend get to found ""Oreo"" in some where. Now, we have to put Oreo up for adoption again. I really hope that a kind person with love and care for animals will adopt Oreo and give him a comfortable live. He has gone through many hardship.

Only 3 are up for adoption right now though. They have been treated for mange, fleas, and worms so far. Their skin looks a bit sad in the photos because of the mange. It'll get better in a week or so! The 3 kittens up for adoption are Riley (black and white, girl), Aspen (cream, boy), and Reagan (black and white, boy). They are all 6 weeks old right now and will be ready to go to their new homes at 8 weeks. The RM50 will be returned to you when you spay/neuter the kittens at 4-6 months. Absolutely NON negotiable! These kittens MUST be sterilized. No exceptions. They must also be vaccinated at the appropriate ages. They are all very friendly and playful. Will not bite or scratch. They have been hand-fed by me, so they are very human oriented. Please e-mail/sms me if you are interested in giving these lovely kitties a new home. Tell me about yourself please, I do not want to receive one line queries asking ""are they still available?"" or ""can I have one?"". These emails will not be entertained. So please, tell me about yourself, your experience with cats/animals, whether or not you have pets of your own, and your living situation (do you rent? own? live with parents?). Any info that you think will help me get to know you better is welcomed! ----------------------------------------- Some personality info: Aspen - He's the adventurer; very brave and always the first to check anything out. He doesn't get scared easily and is very calm. He looks like he's always thinking about something and analyzing the situation! He's a very confident and independent little kitty. Riley - She always makes the MOST noise! Especially when she eats. All you hear is *slurpslurpslurp* *nomnomnomnom* It's so cute! She LOVES to eat. She's becoming kind of pudgy too! But she's very playful and adventurous too. Likes to climb everything and play hide and seek/wrestle with the others. Reagan - He's the quiet one. He is a little shy, but he LOVES being picked up and petted. He ALWAYS purrs when I pick him up and he will sit on your lap indefinitely! He just loves being around people and being held. He's such a sweet little kitty. I call him the cuddlebug!

My brother and I found this adventurous little boycat yesterday stuck in the engine of a motorbike at the Section 17 night hawker centre. We fished him out and cleaned him up, and he's turned out to be a really adorable, friendly, fun five-week-old (estimated) who loves to cuddle people and sleep with or on top of them. He has an almost all black coat with what looks like white or grey ""highlights"" of stripes on his head and chest. Even as I'm typing this right now, he's curled up in my lap. Nishi can eat solid wet kitten food already, and has a clean bill of health from the Gasing Veterinary Hospital; he just got dewormed today. Sadly I can't keep him because my parents won't let me, but PAWS and ASPCA and other sanctuaries I've tried appear to be full up. I'd rather not put him back on the street, though, so if you would like to or you know anyone who'd like to take him into your home, please send me a message! Thanks.

We 'abducted' the pups from their mum hoping that they could be part of a human family, instead of becoming stray like their parents. They are active, super adorable and love to follow people around.

She has a rough medium length coat (black and white). ♥ Kayla is under foster care as her family had to travel overseas due to unforeseen circumstances. Kayla is now seeking a permanent new family. _________________________________________________ Character: ♥ Kayla is an intelligent and high energy dog. She loves taking walks (especially running around fields, beaches, hiking, etc). If you're an active person, she will happily tag along on a leash as you do your daily runs/cycling/etc. :) ♥ DESPITE her energy; Kayla is a VERY calm dog when indoors! She will only get onto beds/sofas if invited and otherwise makes herself comfy where she can. ♥ Kayla understands a few commands like ""sit"", ""stay"" and ""shake"". She was also trained to wait for her food and walk off leash by her previous owners (however I have not followed up on this during the period of foster care). ♥ She has an amazing temperament too! Gets along well with dogs (cats also if she sees them indoors/as part of the family. Kayla is especially patient and loving around children, She's the type of dog that would lie in bed with the kids and keep them feeling safe/protected. ♥ Kayla requires NO grooming whatsoever as her fur stays the length it already is. She also hardly ""smells"" and only needs a bath once a month at most if indoors (unless she's really had a muddy run somewhere or rolled where she shouldn't). ♥ Kayla loves water too! She will half-sit in a pool, even chase after water sprinkling out of a hose. :) ♥ Potty habits; When indoors, Kayla will bark 3 - 4 times in a row to let her people know she needs to be let out to do her business. She appreciates routine daily walks (at least once in the morning, another in the evening before bedtime). ♥ Kayla is fully vaccinated (rabies shots included). She is also spayed, parasite free and micro-chipped. She is not fussy about food either. _________________________________________________ *** PLEASE READ (Note for potential adopters) *** ♥ Kayla takes time to adjust to new people (at least 2 weeks to trust). She will bond closely to anyone who pays the most attention to her. She will accept ""firm"" tones when being trained but NO rough tones/scolding of any kind. ♥ Kayla likes being indoors % EXCEPT when she needs to be taken out for some form of activity. Adopters practicing this are preferred. ♥ Kayla needs round the clock attention (she will get anxious if left crated any longer than 4 hours a day). Adopters with lots of time on their hands are her best preference. ♥ An adoption fee will apply to cover Kayla's basic care (please inquire). Her cards will be passed to successful adopters. :) _________________________________________________ Please drop me a call or email if interested in taking this girl home.

He was bleeding, nervous, skinny & very scared. We rushed to a doctor, and the next day thanks God he became better (But the bill was very big, hehehe). We brought him home loved, feed, cleaned and took care of him very well. Now he is VERY healthy and happy and VERY active. No injuries at all. We named him ""Duke"" :) He is a joy of a cat. Very smart and full of happiness. Plus, he is very funny and creative when playing with us :) He knows well how to use the litter box. To conclude, We are traveling 7th May, after few days!!. And this beautiful kitten can't be safe near streets, he needs a home. So, can you please give Duke a home? Can you take care of him? More info: He is around 2 months old. Crossed breed, and I just assumed from his eyes and ears that he is Javanese though! Because he looks a lot like he is mixed Javanese with domestic or with oriental!

I had an accident several months ago , my right front leg was badly injured, I had to drag my leg when I walked. Later, it became infectious. The pain was unbearable. Everywhere I went, people despised me. Then I found a place at a parking lot in a big condo where I could hide and rest. A lady who lives there noticed me while on her way to work. She was kind to me. As days passed, I began to trust her. One day I threw myself in front of her car and blocked it. I did not move till she came down and saw my condition. She called for her sons and one of her friends for help but i only trusted her, she put a leash on me and sent me to a nearby clinic. By then my leg was badly damaged , the vet had to amputate my front leg. After one week, i was discharged from the clinic but the lady dose not have any place to keep me so she asked somebody for help. My picture was posted up in facebook and lots of good-hearted people called and offered to foster me till I recover. Now I'm fully recovered and in need of a forever loving home.

Currently due to certain circumstances, it is not possible for us to take care of her. Personality She's friendly to humans, always needing their presence while awake. Loves attention. Very active and playful. History Kitten was found wandering near an LRT station and busy roads, thin and hungry. Now she is all bathed and clean. Medically, she is all fine other than being dehydrated & malnourished. Treated for diarrhea, all well now! Not yet spayed as she is still too young. Update: / As she suffered from extreme hunger previously, she has an obsession for food (goes crazy on sight of food). Now after 1+ month of training/therapy, she is much calmer, especially during feeding time. ^^ Update: / She gained g! (Now 2.05kg, only 1.3kg a month ago) Also, first vaccination given. Adoption Criteria Interested cat parent must agree to: 1. Spay her at 5-6 months old. 2. Keep her % free-roam indoors (not caged). 3. Attend to her health needs. 3. Treat her not as a pet, but as a member of the family. :) Also, please arrange to pick her up from our location, with own carrier ready. Play-dates can be arranged with no obligations.

She provided everything she could so Angel can have a chance to live a normal life. Many would believe a dog born with such disabilities should be put to sleep. As the owner is working and fearing Angel may hurt herself, he is currently living in a cage 24 hours a day. The owner would like Angel to have a normal life running and playing around just like other dogs. We are now looking for a loving home for little Angel. It's our hope to find a owner who accept him with this disabilities and love him unconditionally so he can live life to the fullest. Our recommendation to potential adopters : a) Ask yourself the following questions : - Am I ready to be the owner of a blind dog. - Did I have the commitment needed? - Did I have the knowledge? - Did I have the right conditions in my home? - Most importantly, did I have the love in my heart to raise this dog? b) Allocate time so both yourself and Angel can understand each other. c) Provide time for training so Angel can recognise sounds. If you believe you can raise Angel and in return inspired others to care/raise blind puppies, please contact me for further details. “Blind Dogs See With Their Heart and Are Worth Loving”.",d596234fc,4.0,3,0.032258064516129,0.3548387096774194,0.1935483870967742,0.2903225806451613,0.1290322580645161,31.0,200,1,1,0,sweet little angel was born without eyes his owner although devastated never gave up on him she provided everything she could so angel can have chance to live normal life many would believe dog born with such disabilities should be put to sleep as the owner is working and fearing angel may hurt herself he is currently living in cage 24 hours day the owner would like angel to have normal life running and playing around just like other dogs we are now looking for loving home for little angel it our hope to find owner who accept him with this disabilities and love him unconditionally so he can live life to the fullest our recommendation to potential adopters ask yourself the following questions am ready to be the owner of blind dog did have the commitment needed did have the knowledge did have the right conditions in my home most importantly did have the love in my heart to raise this dog allocate time so both yourself and angel can understand each other provide time for training so angel can recognise sounds if you believe you can raise angel and in return inspired others to care raise blind puppies please contact me for further details blind dogs see with their heart and are worth loving,216,105,"['was', 'without', 'his', 'although', 'never', 'up', 'on', 'him', 'she', 'everything', 'she', 'could', 'so', 'can', 'have', 'to', 'many', 'would', 'with', 'such', 'should', 'be', 'put', 'to', 'as', 'the', 'is', 'and', 'may', 'herself', 'he', 'is', 'in', 'the', 'would', 'to', 'have', 'and', 'around', 'other', 'we', 'are', 'now', 'for', 'for', 'it', 'our', 'to', 'find', 'who', 'him', 'with', 'this', 'and', 'him', 'so', 'he', 'can', 'to', 'the', 'our', 'to', 'yourself', 'the', 'am', 'to', 'be', 'the', 'of', 'have', 'the', 'have', 'the', 'have', 'the', 'in', 'my', 'most', 'have', 'the', 'in', 'my', 'to', 'this', 'so', 'both', 'yourself', 'and', 'can', 'each', 'other', 'for', 'so', 'can', 'if', 'you', 'you', 'can', 'and', 'in', 'others', 'to', 'please', 'me', 'for', 'further', 'see', 'with', 'their', 'and', 'are']","['sweet', 'little', 'angel', 'born', 'eyes', 'owner', 'devastated', 'gave', 'provided', 'angel', 'chance', 'live', 'normal', 'life', 'believe', 'dog', 'born', 'disabilities', 'sleep', 'owner', 'working', 'fearing', 'angel', 'hurt', 'currently', 'living', 'cage', '24', 'hours', 'day', 'owner', 'like', 'angel', 'normal', 'life', 'running', 'playing', 'just', 'like', 'dogs', 'looking', 'loving', 'home', 'little', 'angel', 'hope', 'owner', 'accept', 'disabilities', 'love', 'unconditionally', 'live', 'life', 'fullest', 'recommendation', 'potential', 'adopters', 'ask', 'following', 'questions', 'ready', 'owner', 'blind', 'dog', 'did', 'commitment', 'needed', 'did', 'knowledge', 'did', 'right', 'conditions', 'home', 'importantly', 'did', 'love', 'heart', 'raise', 'dog', 'allocate', 'time', 'angel', 'understand', 'provide', 'time', 'training', 'angel', 'recognise', 'sounds', 'believe', 'raise', 'angel', 'return', 'inspired', 'care', 'raise', 'blind', 'puppies', 'contact', 'details', 'blind', 'dogs', 'heart', 'worth', 'loving']",little angel special case,4,1,5,1,2,1,0.0008050051983445883

She was abandoned by the roadside under the scorching hot sun (was around 2pm when i stumble upon her). She was given rice and a shirt inside a box only. Her skin condition was very bad and she can barely moved back then. She was so emaciated i can see all her ribs! I took her to the vet and paid for all her medication. I couldn't bring her back home as I have 2 dogs already. My mom wouldn't allow me to bring her back. So she stayed at the vet for almost 2 months until i found a shelter who is willing to take her in under the condition that i pay them every month. I agreed as I do not wish for her to be caged her whole life. After almost 6 months at the shelter, I got a call to pick her up because the shelter received an eviction letter. She will be moving to a smaller place and will not be able to house so many dogs. So she's giving back all the dogs that was left there. I am keeping her temporary but not for long. I thought of putting her back to the street, but her size is a bit small and she has not been on the street for so long. I'm afraid she will not survive. She is a pretty good guard dog despite her size. Very loving as well. She's very agile and fast too not to mention greedy. She will jump up the table and eat all the food. She survived after eating 12 chocolates! One hell of a tough dog I must say. I'm running out of time, really desperate for an adopter. I really do not wish to put her back on the street.
